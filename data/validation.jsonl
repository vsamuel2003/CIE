{"instruction": "What is the origin of the universe?", "answer": "The scientific consensus is that the universe started with what is called the Big Bang: an incredibly hot and dense primordial state. The Big Bang is inevitable given the cosmological standard model because of two things: we can observe that our universe is expanding today and that the universe contains too much mass for a scenario in which the universe would have contracted and then expanded again. Despite the name the Big Bang was not an explosion that happened somewhere. Instead it's simply the point in time at which all points in the universe were infinitely close together (at least in theory, there are likely parts we don't understand related to dark matter). Still, so far all experimental results in cosmology are consistent with the Big Bang. The history of the universe is very complex so the Big Bang alone cannot satisfy this your question about its origin. Do you have specific questions about the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, inflation, the cosmic microwave background, or the formation of stars and galaxies?", "ans_len": 173, "dataset": "OA1"}

{"instruction": "Can you write a short introduction about the relevance of the term \"monopsony\" in economics? Please use examples related to potential monopsonies in the labour market and cite relevant research.", "answer": "Monopsony is a market structure in which there is a single buyer in a market. In the context of labor markets, a monopsony occurs when there is only one employer in a particular industry or geographic area, giving that employer significant power over the wages and working conditions of workers. This results in a situation where the employer has the ability to suppress wages and reduce the bargaining power of workers.\n\nResearch has shown that the existence of monopsony power in labor markets can have negative effects on workers, such as lower wages, reduced benefits, and limited job opportunities. For example, a study by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) found evidence of monopsony power in certain U.S. labor markets, resulting in lower wages and reduced job opportunities for workers. Similarly, another study by Bharadwaj, Black, and Kolesnikova (2019) found that the presence of a single dominant employer in a local labor market was associated with lower wages for workers.", "ans_len": 159, "dataset": "OA1"}

More specifically, it is secreted by the chief cells in the gastric glands of the stomach lining. Pepsin is an important digestive enzyme that helps break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids, which can then be absorbed by the small intestine. The release of pepsin is stimulated by the presence of food in the stomach, particularly proteins, and by the hormone gastrin, which is released by the stomach in response to the presence of food. Pepsin is also activated by the acidic environment of the stomach, which helps to denature proteins and expose their peptide bonds for cleavage by the enzyme.

The novel's naturalistic style, which draws on contemporary scientific and philosophical theories, was a departure from the romanticism that had previously dominated Spanish literature.\n\nIn Los Pazos de Ulloa, Pardo Bazan combined a realistic portrayal of Galician rural life with a critique of the decadence and corruption of the Galician aristocracy, making the novel a powerful critique of contemporary Spanish society. The book's frank treatment of sexuality and its unsparing depiction of the lives of the rural poor was also a departure from the more sentimental and idealized portrayals of rural life that had previously been common in Spanish literature.\n\nLos Pazos de Ulloa had a major influence on the development of Spanish naturalism and helped to establish Pardo Bazan as one of the leading literary voices of her time.

{"instruction": "Can you provide more tips on how to make the characters consistent when using an image generation AI?", "answer": "Creating consistent characters in AI image generation depends on the specific AI image generator you are using. Achieving consistency with the current AI generators can be challenging, and often involves a significant amount of trial and error.\n\nFor example, if you are using Stable Diffusion, you may need to supplement your text prompts with image-to-image generation to achieve a consistent style. Additionally, including a character name in the prompt can also help maintain consistency. Another useful technique is to keep the prompt the same and use the Control Net model to place the characters in the scene. If you are an experienced artist, you could use AI image generation to create a rough direction and then redraw the characters in your own style.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that AI generation is not yet advanced enough to generate a complete manga based solely on a prompt.

The atmosphere is made up of gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen, and when sunlight enters the atmosphere, it gets scattered in all different directions by the gases. However, blue light is scattered more than other colors because it has a shorter wavelength, which means it bounces around more when it interacts with the air molecules.\n\nSo, when we look up at the sky, we see mostly the blue light that has been scattered in all directions, giving the sky its blue hue. This is also why the sky appears to be darker at higher altitudes, where there is less atmosphere to scatter the light.", "ans_len": 163, "dataset": "OA2"}

The term 'written' is quite neutral and doesn't imply any sentiment on its own.\n\nHowever, as the phrase a finely written is incomplete, it would be more accurate to say it has a potential positive sentiment due to the adjective 'finely'.

MSG, the sodium salt of a naturally-occurring amino acid, hits up the umami sensors.\n\nThis taste is most often described as brothy, savory, or meaty. Glutamates are found in some fruits and vegetables (like tomatoes and mushrooms), but most often in fermented foods, like soy sauce or hard cheeses, and give them an added flavor boost. Hydrolyzed proteins and yeasts also yield glutamates.\n\nWhen used in small amounts (much less than table salt), MSG adds this additional dimension to the food\u2019s flavor profile. Overuse of MSG, often as a substitute for more expensive ingredients, can result in flavors that many people find unpleasant.\n\nThough an extremely small portion of the population (probably less than 1%) exhibit an intolerance to MSG as individuals can to any food, it is a safe food ingredient in use for more than a century.\n\nI hope that clears the mechanism of action of MSG.", "ans_len": 185, "dataset": "OA1"}
{"instruction": "How might one describe the sentiment of this review?\nThis weekend was my second time at Tao and I don't think I will go back.   My friends and I(around 17 people) were celebrating our close friend's birthday when one of our friends was turned away because the bouncers didn't believe that the person in her driver's license was her. She is 24 years old and has never been refused at ANY clubs in ANY city because of anyone not believing the person in the photo was not her. She got into Tao 2 years earlier when she was 22! Also, my friend's younger sister got in and she didn't. That doesn't make sense to me. I would think that after being a bouncer for a long time, one should be able to tell from the features in a driver's license picture and be able to compare it to a real person. My friend offered other forms(plural) of identification but Tao's management said they could only accept a passport. Who would bring a passport to a club? To Vegas? This incident ruined the rest of our evening and of course we couldn't have a good time at Tao when my friend was not able to get in.  We left Tao and went to two other clubs that night and my friend got in without a problem.

At the time, the U.S. government was facing a severe shortage of gold reserves, which were necessary to back up the U.S. dollar. Roosevelt believed that hoarding of gold by private citizens was exacerbating the problem by reducing the supply of gold available to the government.\n\nTo address this issue, Roosevelt ordered the confiscation of privately held gold coins and bullion and required individuals to exchange their gold for paper currency at a fixed price of $20.67 per ounce. This effectively devalued the U.S. dollar and allowed the government to increase its gold reserves.\n\nRoosevelt's administration argued that this measure was necessary to stabilize the economy and prevent further banking failures, as the lack of confidence in the U.S. dollar was causing people to withdraw their money from banks, which in turn reduced the banks' ability to lend money.", "ans_len": 168, "dataset": "OA2"}

The equation is 0 = 1749*l + 611*l + 173135 + 95905. \n\nTo solve this, we need to simplify the equation by combining like terms. We can add 1749*l and 611*l together to get 2360*l.

Furthermore, most new-ish devices *do* support Vulkan, including both Android, iOS, and the latest Mac and Windows, and all future devices will almost certainly support it.

{"instruction": "Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations.

Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848.\n\nO'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, \"The most remarkable thing about O'Keefe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.\" At that time, even in Europe, there were few arts exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style. She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life. O'Keeffe was also known for her relationship with Stieglitz, in which she provided some insight in her autobiography.  A substantial part of her estate's assets were transferred to the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiu house, library, and property. The Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiu was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and is now owned by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.  In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp honoring O'Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O'Keeffe's Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie's II, 1930 as part of their Modern Art in America series.  A fossilized species of archosaur was named Effigia okeeffeae (\"O'Keeffe's Ghost\") in January 2006, \"in honor of Georgia O'Keeffe for her numerous paintings of the badlands at Ghost Ranch and her interest in the Coelophysis Quarry when it was discovered\".

While excessive use of social media may have negative effects on mental health, moderate and mindful use of social media can have positive effects on mental health by providing social support and facilitating social connections.", "ans_len": 134}

The use of the apostrophe  '  after Trkiye is due to the addition of the possessive suffix (-nIn) for showing the economy belongs to Turkey, making it Trkiye'nin.\n\n2. Economy - The English word economy translates to ekonomi in Turkish. When combined with the possessive suffix, Trkiye'nin Ekonomisi becomes Turkey's Economy.\n\n3. Rebounds - In the context of the economy, rebound means a recovery or a bounce back to a better situation. In Turkish, rebound can be translated as toparlanmak (to recover, to gather).

This is done through a process called backpropagation, which calculates the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network.\n\nThe backward() function is typically used in combination with an optimizer, which uses the gradients calculated by the backward pass to adjust the weights and biases in the network in the direction that minimizes the loss function.\n\nOverall, the backward() function is a crucial component of the neural network training process, as it allows the network to learn from the input data and adjust its weights and biases to improve its predictions or classifications.", "ans_len": 180, "dataset": "OA1"}

This is because the formation of canyons is directly linked to the erosive power of water, which gradually carves out the rock and sediment over time. As a result, it is likely that many canyons are located near rivers or other water sources, and that these bodies of water continue to play a significant role in shaping and changing the landscape around the canyon. Additionally, it is possible that other natural processes, such as wind erosion or tectonic activity, may also occur near canyons, but the primary factor in their formation and ongoing evolution is likely to be the presence of water.", "ans_len": 143}

The sentence is a complex conditional statement, which means that it expresses a hypothetical relationship between two events. In this case, the first event is Mary listening to the Grateful Dead, and the second event is her getting depressed.\n\nHowever, the sentence is not entirely clear because it is not clear what the speaker means by not entirely obvious.

{"instruction": "What about E(x^y)? Is it true that E(x^y)=E(x)^(E(y))?", "answer": "No, it is not generally true that E(X^Y) = E(X)^E(Y).\n\nThis is because the expectation operator is nonlinear and does not generally satisfy the property of taking exponents.\n\nIn particular, the property E(aX) = aE(X) only holds for a constant a, and does not hold for a random variable Y.\n\nTo see this, consider the following counterexample: Let X be a standard normal random variable and let Y = X^2. Then we have:\n\nE(X) = 0, and E(Y) = E(X^2) = Var(X) + E(X)^2 = 1\n\nHowever, E(X^Y) is not equal to E(X)^E(Y). In fact, it is not even clear how to compute E(X^Y) in closed form, since the distribution of X^Y is generally complicated and does not have a simple formula.\n\nSo in general, we cannot simplify the expectation of a function of two random variables in this way, and we need to compute it directly from the joint distribution of X and Y.", "ans_len": 165, "dataset": "OA2"}

The phrase pieces do not fit suggests that the plot is disjointed or poorly constructed, which would be a negative critique of the movie.\n\nHowever, if the sentence is referring to a specific aspect of the movie, such as the acting or the special effects, it could be interpreted in a more neutral or even positive way.

Therefore, planting trees on the east and west sides of a building is a good way to balance the benefits of summer shading with the corresponding loss of winter heating.", "ans_len": 119}

The law also requires electric companies to generate 60% of their power from renewable sources by 2030. Some people are worried that this will make electricity more expensive and hurt workers in the coal industry, but Governor Brown says that it is important to take action to protect the environment. He has also issued an executive order calling for the state to be carbon neutral by 2045, which means that California will work to remove as much pollution from the air as it creates.

Both phenomena have (at least) two different mechanisms of action.  \n\nFirst, polar ice caps are melting because the world as a whole is just a tiny bit warmer. Second, even more polar ice is melting because the greenhouse effect causes temperatures to equalize more worldwide - which means that the poles get more warming than the rest of the world.  The second effect has caused more temperature change and melting than the first.\n\nSea levels are rising because of the water volume of melted ice.  But ice that's already floating doesn't change the water level when it melts, so sea level rise from meltwater only happens with ice that had been on land prior to melting.  The main driver of rising sea levels has been that the oceans of the world are one to one and a half degrees (Celsius) warmer than they were previously and water expands as it warms taking up more volume.", "ans_len": 171, "dataset": "OA2"}

Each subspecies may have slightly different dietary preferences depending on their habitat and availability of food sources.\n\nMountain gorillas (a subspecies of eastern gorillas) primarily feed on leaves, stems, and shoots, with a preference for plants in the family Urticaceae, which include stinging nettles and other similar plants. They also eat fruit when it's available, but fruit makes up a smaller portion of their diet compared to other gorilla subspecies.\n\nLowland gorillas (both eastern and western) typically have more access to fruit in their habitats, so fruit makes up a larger part of their diet compared to mountain gorillas. They still consume leaves, stems, and shoots but have a more varied diet due to the increased availability of food sources in their environment.", "ans_len": 192, "dataset": "OA1"}

{"instruction": "Social Security income for the highest fifth may be lower than for the previous fifth because, among other possible reasons, some elderly workers or their spouses may not yet be collecting benefits.\n\nDoes it follow that \"People collecting their spouses Social Security may delay it up to 5 years.\"?", "answer": "No, it does not necessarily follow that People collecting their spouses Social Security may delay it up to 5 years. from the given statement. The statement only suggests that some elderly workers or their spouses may not yet be collecting benefits, which could be due to various reasons such as they may not have reached the age of eligibility, they may have chosen to delay their benefits, or they may not have worked enough to qualify for Social Security benefits. \n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to assume that all people collecting their spouses' Social Security benefits will delay it up to 5 years.

Some people may choose to delay their benefits to receive a higher monthly benefit amount, while others may choose to start receiving benefits as soon as they are eligible.", "ans_len": 155}
{"instruction": "Music depicting violence against women encourages men (and women) not to respect women.\nCome up with some evidence to support this claim.", "answer": "Well, evidence shows that exposure to violent music can have a negative impact on people's attitudes and behaviors towards women. For example, studies have found that men who listen to music with violent and misogynistic lyrics are more likely to hold negative attitudes towards women, such as believing that women are inferior to men or that it's acceptable to use violence against women. Additionally, research has shown that exposure to violent music can desensitize people to violence and make them more accepting of it in real life situations. \n\nFurthermore, music is a powerful tool for shaping cultural norms and values. When popular music promotes violence against women, it can send the message that this behavior is acceptable or even desirable. This can contribute to a culture where violence against women is normalized and not taken seriously. \n\nSo, in summary, exposure to music that depicts violence against women can have a negative impact on people's attitudes and behaviors towards women, and can contribute to a culture where violence against women is normalized.", "ans_len": 174}
{"instruction": "Lily had $55 in her account. She spent $7 on a shirt. She then went to another shop and spent thrice as much as she spent on a shirt. How much money is left in Lily's account? Let's be accurate as possible.", "answer": "First, let's find out how much Lily spent in the second shop. She spent 3 times the amount she spent on the shirt, which was $7. So, we'll multiply 7 by 3:\n\n3 * $7 = $21\n\nNow, let's add the total amount she spent on both the shirt and the purchase in the second shop:\n\n$7 + $21 = $28\n\nLily initially had $55 in her account. To find out how much money she has left, subtract the total amount she spent ($28) from her initial account balance ($55):\n\n$55 - $28 = $27\n\nSo, Lily now has $27 left in her account.", "ans_len": 101}
{"instruction": "If \"Three men are standing outside a building looking down towards the ground.\", does it logically follow that \"Three men are outside a building.\"?", "answer": "Yes, it logically follows that Three men are outside a building if they are standing outside a building looking down towards the ground. This is because the statement Three men are standing outside a building looking down towards the ground implies that the men are physically located outside the building. \n\nThe phrase looking down towards the ground suggests that the men are positioned at a higher elevation than the ground, which further supports the idea that they are outside the building. If they were inside the building, it would be unlikely that they would be looking down towards the ground.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the three men are indeed outside the building. However, it is important to note that this inference is based solely on the given statement and does not take into account any additional information or context that may be relevant.", "ans_len": 150}
